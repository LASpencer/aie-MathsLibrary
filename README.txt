Static Library:

Copy the MathsLibrary.lib and all header files from the MathsLibrary project into a folder in your 
solution. Link to it as you would any other static library. It can also be used as a header only library.

The .lib file contains instantiations of the Vector<2>, Vector<3>, Vector<4>, Matrix<2>, Matrix<3> and 
Matrix<4> classes.


All classes are within the lasmath namespace
